## About
**un(Bear)able** is a customised userstyle.css for the awesome open-source note-taking app, [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org), based off of the default theme included with [Bear](http://bear.app). 

un(Bear)able themes the markdown preview pane within Joplin and also applies to HTML and PDF exports.

## Installation
#### Required Fonts
un(Bear)able works best when you download and install the font families listed below, without these, Joplin will default to its built-in fonts. 

- [**Nunito**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito) - A well balanced sans serif typeface, created by Vernon Adams as a rounded terminal sans serif for display typography.

- [**Jetbrains Mono**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/JetBrains+Mono) - A typeface made for the specific needs of developers, designed by Philipp Nurullin and Konstantin Bulenkov.

#### Theme Installation
- Download the [userstyle.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ntt4/unbearable/main/userstyle.css) from this repository and place it into your Joplin configuration directory.
- Copy userstyle.css to the Joplin configuration directory
	- On linux and macOS, Joplins' configuration directory is at `~/.config/joplin-desktop`
	- On Windows, Joplins' configuration directory is at `C:\users\<username>\.config\joplin-desktop` 
- Once you have navigated to the configuration directory, either copy or move the downloaded userstyle.css into the root of the directory. **Note!** If the file already exists, ensure that you back this up, as you may already have a custom theme installed that you may wish to revert to! 
- Open / restart Joplin for the theme to take effect
